     * Hint: 
     *      to extract the information of each fragments, we can use

     *          s.indexOf(String target)
     *          s.indexOf(char target)
     *
     *      for example, assume we have: 
     *          String s = "description1:ABCD;  description2:EFGH;  description3:IJKL;"
     *      if we want to find the data for description 2, we can first take the substring of the entire string from the letter 'E'
     *      but first we need to find the index of 'E', we can do it by find the index of the string "description2:" and add 13("description2" is 13 chars long)to it
     *      and then we can take the substring from 'E' until the end of the entire string
     *      now use s.substring to exract:
     *          "EFGH;  description3:IJKL;" and let's call it newString for now. 
     *      to extract "EFGH" (the data we want) from newString. we need to find the index of the first ';' which we can simply use newString.indexOf(';')
     *      then we can take the substring of the newString knowing the index of ;
     *      we now have extracted "EFGH" from the String s
     *      the last step is just to convert the datatype based on what type of data we are extracting
